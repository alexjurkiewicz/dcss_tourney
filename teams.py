#A team member should have the following as the first line of her rcfile:
# TEAMCAPTAIN <captain's name>
#The space serves as separator.
#The team captain should have the following as the first line of her rcfile:
# TEAMNAME <team name>
#The space serves as separator, spaces in the team name will be removed.
#Further, the team captain should have the following as the second line of her
#rcfile:
# TEAMMEMBERS <member1> <member2> ...
#A player is considered part of a team, if both she "volunteered" to the team's
#captain by putting the captain's name in her rcfile AND the captain "drafted"
#her by listing her as a member of the team, that she's also named.
